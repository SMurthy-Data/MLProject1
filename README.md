# Details of the Project:
Its an End to End ML project:
1. Initialized with README.md, setup.py and synching the git repository 
- Make GIT global configuration for the first time initialization to the git
    - $ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    - $ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
- The `setup.py` file is essential in Python projects intended for distribution, as it defines the package's metadata, dependencies, and instructions for building and installing the project. It enables tools like `setuptools` and `pip` to install the project as a reusable package, making it especially important when publishing to PyPI or sharing the project with others. In contrast, `requirements.txt` is typically used to list all the packages needed to run the project in a specific environment, often including exact version numbers. While `setup.py` is used to define the core dependencies for packaging and distribution, `requirements.txt` is primarily used for setting up development or deployment environments with all the necessary libraries. Both files can coexist, serving different but complementary purposes in a well-organized Python project.
